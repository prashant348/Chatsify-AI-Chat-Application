You: today's date?
Bot: Today is June 25, 2025.

You: you are an AI
Bot: Yes, I am‚Äîan AI developed by Moonshot AI.

You: you are an AI
Bot: Yes ‚Äî I'm Kimi, an AI assistant developed by Moonshot AI. How can I assist you today?

You: you are chinese ai?
Bot: I‚Äôm Kimi, a large language model developed by Moonshot AI, rather than a "Chinese AI" specifically. I'm designed to understand and communicate effectively in both Chinese and other languages, but I'm not a Chinese AI exclusively.

You: who built you?
Bot: I'm Kimi, a large language model developed by Moonshot AI.

You: hi
Bot: Hey there! How can I help you today?

You: types of APIs and their use?
Bot: APIs are not all the same shape; they sit at different layers of the stack, expose different things, and are optimised for different jobs.  
The easiest way to keep the zoo straight is to ask two questions:

1. What **transport / protocol** is used to reach the API?  
2. What **style / contract** does the API expose once you reach it?

Below are the main answers you will meet in the wild, what each one is good for, and a one-sentence ‚Äúuse it when ‚Ä¶‚Äù rule.

-------------------------------------------------
1. Transport-oriented families
-------------------------------------------------
1.1 REST (HTTP)  
    ‚Ä¢ Stateless, resource-oriented, uses the verbs of HTTP (GET, POST ‚Ä¶).  
    ‚Ä¢ Payload normally JSON, but can be XML, binary, etc.  
    ‚Ä¢ Use when you want the simplest, most cache-friendly way to expose data over the web.

1.2 GraphQL (HTTP)  
    ‚Ä¢ Single end-point; client specifies nested shape of data it wants.  
    ‚Ä¢ Use when the client UI is complex, bandwidth is scarce, or you need to aggregate many backend services in one request.

1.3 gRPC (HTTP/2)  
    ‚Ä¢ Contract-first with Protocol Buffers; bi-directional streaming.  
    ‚Ä¢ Use for low-latency internal service-to-service calls, especially in polyglot micro-service stacks.

1.4 WebSocket / Socket.io  
    ‚Ä¢ Full-duplex TCP socket tunneled over HTTP(S).  
    ‚Ä¢ Use for chat, live dashboards, multiplayer games‚Äîanything that needs real-time push.

1.5 Webhooks (HTTP)  
    ‚Ä¢ Reverse REST: you register a URL; the server POSTs to it when something happens.  
    ‚Ä¢ Use to receive asynchronous events from Stripe, GitHub, Twilio, etc.

1.6 Server-Sent Events (HTTP)  
    ‚Ä¢ One-way stream from server to client over ordinary HTTP.  
    ‚Ä¢ Use when only the server needs to push (news feed, stock ticker) and you want to avoid the complexity of WebSockets.

-------------------------------------------------
2. Style-oriented families
-------------------------------------------------
2.1 SOAP (XML over HTTP, SMTP, JMS ‚Ä¶)  
    ‚Ä¢ Strict WSDL contract, built-in error handling (faults), WS-* security.  
    ‚Ä¢ Use inside large enterprises or legacy banking systems that already rely on WS-Security, transactions, etc.

2.2 XML-RPC / JSON-RPC  
    ‚Ä¢ Simple remote-procedure-call: one method name, ordered parameters.  
    ‚Ä¢ Use for lightweight internal scripting when you do not need REST‚Äôs resource modelling.

2.3 OpenAPI-first REST  
    ‚Ä¢ REST with a machine-readable Swagger/OpenAPI spec that can generate client SDKs.  
    ‚Ä¢ Use when you must ship SDKs in many languages and keep docs in sync with code.

2.4 AsyncAPI / CloudEvents  
    ‚Ä¢ Same idea as OpenAPI, but for event-driven or messaging APIs (Kafka, RabbitMQ).  
    ‚Ä¢ Use to document topics, schemas, and headers when you publish events.

-------------------------------------------------
3. Layer-specific families
-------------------------------------------------
3.1 Library / Language APIs  
    ‚Ä¢ The #include or import you do every day‚Äîe.g., the Java List API.  
    ‚Ä¢ Use to build software inside one process.

3.2 Operating-system APIs (POSIX, Win32)  
    ‚Ä¢ Kernel syscalls exposed as C functions.  
    ‚Ä¢ Use when writing native apps or drivers.

3.3 Hardware / Firmware APIs (GPIO, I¬≤C, UART)  
    ‚Ä¢ Use to blink LEDs on a Raspberry Pi or read a temperature sensor.

3.4 Browser APIs (DOM, Fetch, WebRTC, WebGL)  
    ‚Ä¢ JavaScript interfaces provided by the browser.  
    ‚Ä¢ Use to build front-end web applications.

3.5 Third-party SaaS APIs  
    ‚Ä¢ Twilio (SMS), SendGrid (email), Stripe (payments), Google Maps (geo).  
    ‚Ä¢ Use to add capabilities you do not want to build or maintain.

-------------------------------------------------
4. Message-bus & streaming APIs
-------------------------------------------------
4.1 Kafka Producer/Consumer API  
    ‚Ä¢ High-throughput durable log.  
    ‚Ä¢ Use for event sourcing, analytics pipeline.

4.2 AMQP (RabbitMQ)  
    ‚Ä¢ Reliable queuing with routing rules.  
    ‚Ä¢ Use for task queues, retries, competing consumers.

4.3 MQTT  
    ‚Ä¢ Tiny header, QoS levels, pub/sub.  
    ‚Ä¢ Use for IoT sensors on 2G links.

-------------------------------------------------
5. Choosing quickly
-------------------------------------------------
Need browser + mobile + CDN caching? ‚Üí REST (OpenAPI)  
Need one request to fetch nested UI data? ‚Üí GraphQL  
Need 50 ¬µs latency between Go and Python services? ‚Üí gRPC  
Need Slack to tell you when someone posts? ‚Üí Webhook  
Need live sports scores on the page? ‚Üí WebSocket or SSE  
Need to pay an invoice from SAP to a 1990s mainframe? ‚Üí SOAP  
Need to blink an LED on an ESP32? ‚Üí GPIO Hardware API

You: hi
Bot: Hey! What can I help you with today?

You: bjhgjghjghj
Bot: It looks like your message might have been a typo or a test ‚Äî could you clarify what you meant or what you'd like help with?

You: hey, i want to know exact number of  how many API calls i can do per day on this AI model
Bot: Hey! There‚Äôs no single, universal ‚Äúdaily limit‚Äù for the model itself‚Äîhow many calls you can make in a day is controlled entirely by the usage tier (a.k.a. rate-limit bucket) that your personal OpenAI account falls into.  
So the only way to get an exact number is to look up your own account:

1. Log in to https://platform.openai.com  
2. Open the sidebar ‚Üí ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúLimits‚Äù (or go directly to https://platform.openai.com/account/limits)  
3. Find the row for the model you‚Äôre using (e.g. gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo, etc.).  
   ‚Äì The first column shows the TPM (tokens-per-minute) limit.  
   ‚Äì The second column shows the RPM (requests-per-minute) limit.  
   ‚Äì The third column shows the RPD (requests-per-day) limit.  
   That RPD number is the exact maximum API calls you can make per day for that model with your current key.

If you just created a paid account you‚Äôll typically start at something like:

gpt-3.5-turbo: 200 RPM / 40k TPM / 10k RPD  
gpt-4: 200 RPM / 10k TPM / 10k RPD  

Higher tiers (Tier 2‚Äì5) scale those numbers up automatically as your cumulative spend increases. If you need more than your current tier allows you can also request a quota increase from the same ‚ÄúLimits‚Äù page.

So the short answer: the exact daily call limit is the RPD value shown in your personal OpenAI dashboard; it‚Äôs not a fixed number that applies to everyone.
